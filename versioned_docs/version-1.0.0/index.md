# Medusa Documentation

Medusa is an open-source, headless commerce framework built for developers. It gives you the backend infrastructure to power any commerce experience, with full control over your stack.

## What is Medusa?

Medusa provides a composable set of commerce modules—orders, products, inventory, pricing, customers, and more—exposed through a RESTful API. You bring your own storefront, admin UI, and integrations.

**Key value propositions:**

- **Headless** — decoupled backend; connect any frontend or channel
- **Modular** — use only the modules your project needs; replace or extend any module
- **API-first** — every capability is accessible via REST; build mobile apps, storefronts, POS, or B2B portals on the same core
